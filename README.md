## EEG-PreProp-RAG, inspired by CodeRAG-Bench
> An EEG-specific RAG preprocessing model, inspired by the revolutionary project "CodeRAG-Bench: Can Retrieval Augment Code Generation?" and implemented using a RAG pipeline with open retrieval and code generation.

### Project Goals

Beginning as a final project for a Caltech class *CS 159: Advanced Topics in Machine Learning*, we were inspired to expand on the existing CodeRAG-Bench paper for EEG preprocessing specifically. EEG preprocessing is a foundational step in BCI Research, and yet is often overlooked, lacking a standardized protocol and often causing issues in downstream tasks. Our work focuses on building from the CODERAG-BENCH framework to create a benchmark tailored to EEG workflows. 

- Follows a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) structure.
- Draws on MNE documentation, public EEG-specific GitHub repositories, and domain-specific Stack Overflow discussions.
- Supports both canonical and open retrieval methods
- Evaluates robustness, syntax validity, and task achievement using GPT 3.5
